# German Credit Risk Prediction

This project explores binary classification techniques for predicting credit risk using the South German Credit Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [South German Credit (Updated)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/573/south+german+credit+update)
- The dataset contains socio-economic and financial features used to assess creditworthiness.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict whether a loan applicant is a credit risk (`good` or `bad`) based on customer data.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation using:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
  - Model comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Files
- `credit_risk_model.html`: Code and output notebook (rendered as HTML)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
